# हेल्थCare
A virtual AI-based assistant that displays the user's health status using lab reports. It also consists of an AI-based chatbot that is useful for people to ask queries.

## The problem हेल्थCare solves
This AI based model can be helpful for the assistant present in the laboratories while the doctors are not available or are out of reach due to any reason . This can be helpful in determining the health issues of the patient during its visit to labs . This is a trained model so doctor's consultancy is a must but still many a times there can be possiblities of emergency situations and hence this model can be helpful at that instance .
